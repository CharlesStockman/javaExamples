TreeMap vs HashMap

    Hashmap -- hashtable based implementation -- when the buckets get too large they get transformed into treenodes
    TreeMap -- Self Balancing Binary Search Tree

    Order
    Hashmap -- no guarantee of order
    Treemap -- sorted according to their natural order

    null values
    Hashmap -- one null value keys
    TreeMap -- no null value keys

    Duplicate values -- Both

    Synchronized -- Not, but can use synchronzied map if needed

    Iterator -- Fail Fast

    A hashmap rquires way more memory than required to hold data and should not be more than .75 percent fulls
        Rehashing is costly

    Use when we know approx number of values and don't extract items in a natural order

    TreeMap
        We don't know how many elements
        We want to extract object in a natural order
        Items will be constantly added or removed
        willing to accept log(n)
